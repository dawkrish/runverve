Server written in javascript, using Express JS

I have used a local file-based database , by the file "database.json"

I have implement sign-in , log-in and verifying whether user is authorized to certain routes or not (basically checking if they are logged in or not)

The code is well documented and explains each function and routes

Steps to preview (`Node` & `Git` must be installed)

Run these commands one by one in your terminal

> `git clone https://github.com/krishnanshagarwal112/runverve.git`

> `npm install`

> `npm start`
